* FlyToBuild - queues up commands to send the mecha to nearby build previews (until all are built)
* FastBuild - slightly cheaty option where builds are done as quickly as the game allows but inventory items _are_ consumed
* FreeBuild - cheaty option where inventory items are not consumed and builds are done as quickly as the game allows. This mode will disable achievements for your save
* Disabled - default setting at each game start in order to prevent accidental disabling of achievements
