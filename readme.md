Long Arm

Provides tools to make planet-wide building a little easier. Open UI with Control+L (configurable in Settings). Starts up with inspect and bot build range extended, 
but with no Build Helper Modes enabled. 

Does not affect saved games, build range changes are reverted prior to the game saving its data

### Build Helper Modes

In addition to extending build range, additional modes are provided to make building planet wide blueprints a little less painful. These are optional, but may
be useful in certain situations. All 3 of the active ones will work even when the build range is not overridden.

* FlyToBuild - queues up commands to send the mecha to nearby build previews (until all are built)
* FastBuild - slightly cheaty option where builds are done as quickly as the game allows but inventory items _are_ consumed
* FreeBuild - very cheaty option where inventory items are not consumed and builds are done as quickly as the game allows. This mode will disable achievements for your save
* None - default setting at each game start in order to prevent accidental disabling of achievements in the case where a different game save was loaded after setting FreeBuild mode
